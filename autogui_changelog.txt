v.20241126
- Major release with many new features!
- New: User customization accessible from via preferences in the launcher menu:
    - Default input and output paths 
    - Subfolders to create when "prepare folder" is selected
    - Option to now also prepare folders in AutoGUI Batch
    - And custom color themes!!! Dark/light modes with currently 6 choosable highlight colors, applies to all AutoGUI windows and HTML outputs
- Reworked launcher
- Reworked AutoGUI Batch interface
- Added: Display of elapsed days in batch processing log
- Changed: Versioning scheme (v.20241126 is equivalent to a 0.9.0 version according to the previous scheme, but 1.0 is still far away)

0.8.0:
- A major release with many new features!
- New: Dark theme
- New: Completely reworked launcher. Previous results will be displayed in a table and can be exported as HTML or CSV.
- New: AutoGUI Batch will now try processing in up to 3 selected modes (fast, normal and/or problematic) until one (or none) works. 
- Added: Option to export custom macros (a.k.a parameter file) (AutoGUI Classic)

0.8_preview:
- This version has still some features missing that should be included in a full 0.8 release, but to many changes to still count as a 0.7 release.
- Added: Possibility to add command line arguments for each dataset (AutoGUI Classic)
- Added: Manual controls over high res. cutoff criteria (AutoGUI Classic)
- Added: Automatic determination of high res. cutoff criteria switchable between new and old behavior (CC(1/2) >= 0.3 or  I/sig(I) >= 2.0), as used until autoPROC Version 20220608) (AutoGUI Batch)
- Added: Improved controls for handling of anomalous data (AutoGUI Classic)
- Added: Tab to adjust experimental settings (AutoGUI Classic):
    - View image header
    - Run beam centre finding routines
    - Manually set beam coordinates, distance, wavelength, oscillation angle, ...
    - If header values are wrong, these settings can also be extrtacted from an XDS.INP file (e.g. from beamline auto-processing pipelines)
- Added: Tool to draw masks (XDS untrusted rectangles/ellipses/quadrilaterals) and adjust direct beam coordinates on a the diffraction image (AutoGUI Classic).
  This also includes a function to quickly mask HPAD (Pilatus, Eiger, ...) module gaps.
- Added: Reference/FreeR MTZ can be extended to high resolution. (AutoGUI Classic)  
- Added: Button to browse currently used data directory. (AutoGUI Classic & AutoGUI Batch)
- Added: Option to link data from auto-processing pipelines at beamline (Known to work with DESY P11, SLS PX I & III, BESSY II beamlines 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, some ESRF beamlines)(AutoGUI Classic) 
- Added: Inhouse detector / beamline setup can be fully configured in autogui.cfg. (AutoGUI Classic)
- Added: Optional clean up routine (default = on) to reduce used disk space by deleting usually not required files. (AutoGUI Classic & AutoGUI Batch) 
- Fixed: Program will not attempt to run if path names contain white spaces. (AutoGUI Classic & AutoGUI Batch)
- Fixed: Reworked AutoGUI Classic GUI to remove collapsible sections that would cause issues with MobaXterm under Windows. (AutoGUI Classic)
- Fixed: Folders for MR, refinement, etc. were created in the ./autoproc/autoproc_x folder instead two levels above. (AutoGUI Classic)
- Fixed: Timers in the AutoGUI Batch HTML output are now based on JavaScript instead of self-refreshing frames to reduce load on displaying computers. Refresh-times for console and progress-meter frames have been reduced. (AutoGUI Batch)
- Fixed: Windows should (hopefully) not look weird anymore on different Unix systems.
- Fixed: Adjustments with regards to changes in Nov22 release of autoPROC.
- Fixed: Crash if scaling fails but "isotropic.mtz" is still written (AutoGUI Batch)
- Fixed: "Silenced" messages from webbrowser.
- Known issue: Masking the beam stop on a multi sweep dataset with different 2-theta settings per sweep will be wrong for every sweep except the first one. (AutoGUI Classic)
  This is due to different positions of the beam stop shadow on the detector. Masks around features on the detector (gaps, dead pixels) will however be correct.
  The position of the beam center is corrected for the 2-theta offset.
- AutoGUI has now a logo.  

0.7.6:
- Fixed: Prevented segmentation faults by changing the way threads communicate with the main process. (AutoGUI Classic)
- Fixed: Windows won't appear between two monitors anymore. (all modules)

- Added: New menu for improved output file access in HTML (AutoGUI Batch)

- Added: Link to autoPROC parameters in custom parameters window (AutoGUI Classic) and as help function for custom arguments (AutoGui Batch)
